# Pixel Brawl

A pixel-art fighting game (1P vs CPU or 2P local) written as plain ES modules. No build step, no dependencies.

## Project layout

```
index.html          page shell + touch buttons
css/style.css       layout
src/config.js       constants, fighter roster (CHARS), key bindings
src/game.js         game rules (rounds, timer, physics) - no DOM
src/fighter.js      movement, attacks, blocking
src/combat.js       hitboxes and damage
src/ai.js           CPU opponent
src/input.js        keyboard, mouse and touch input
src/audio.js        music, sound effects and mute settings
src/render.js       all canvas drawing
src/main.js         wires everything together, runs the game loop
assets/audio/       local CC0 music and sound effects
assets/fighters/    fighter portraits and animated action sheets
tools/              asset scripts (clean_sprites.py rebuilds the action sheets)
tests/              automated tests (Node)
```

Game logic (`game.js`, `fighter.js`, `combat.js`, `ai.js`) never touches the browser, so it is unit-tested, including a stress test that mashes random buttons for 80,000 frames and checks the state never breaks.

## Fighters

| Fighter | Style | Special |
|---|---|---|
| KAI | Balanced all-rounder | Fireball (long range) |
| ROX | Fast, low health | Dash Strike (rush forward) |
| BRUNO | Slow tank, huge health | Quake Wave (slow, heavy projectile) |
| MIRA | Highest jump | Rising Kick (anti-air) |
| SORA | Zoner | Rapid Shot (fast, cheap projectile) |
| TORA | Heavy brawler | Tiger Rush (charging strike) |

On the select screen, click a fighter to see their stats (health, speed, power), punch / kick / special damage and description at the bottom. Player 1's pick shows on the left, Player 2's on the right. To add a fighter, append an entry to `CHARS` in `src/config.js`.

## Run

Modules need a web server (double-clicking `index.html` will not work):

```
python3 -m http.server 8000     # then open http://localhost:8000
```

## Test

```
npm test        # needs Node 18+
```

## Controls

| Action | Player 1 | Player 2 |
|---|---|---|
| Move / jump / crouch | W A S D | Arrow keys |
| Punch / Kick / Special | F / G / H | K / L / ; |
| Super Art (full meter) | J | ' (quote) |
| Block | V (or hold away from opponent) | / (or hold away) |

Click or tap a menu option (or press 1 / 2). On phones, on-screen buttons control Player 1. `Esc` pauses a match; use it to return from character select or the tutorial.

## Deploy (GitHub Pages)

Settings > Pages > Deploy from a branch > `main` / root. The game is served at `https://<user>.github.io/<repo>/`.

## Combat system

| Move / rule | How it works |
|---|---|
| Punch / Kick | Standard attacks. Special-cancel: after a normal connects (or is blocked) press Special to cancel into it. |
| Crouch jab (Down + Punch) | Very fast, good for starting combos. |
| Sweep (Down + Kick) | Low attack: must be blocked crouching. Knocks the opponent down. |
| Jump punch / Fly kick (Jump, then Punch / Kick) | Overhead: must be blocked standing. Lands into recovery. |
| Block | Hold the block button (`V` / `/`, controller LT or RT, touch BLOCK) or hold away from the opponent. Holding the block button plants your feet. Stand-block stops mid + overhead, crouch-block stops mid + low. Blocked hits do small chip damage (never a KO). |
| Counter hit | Hitting someone who is mid-attack: +25% damage and longer hit-stun. |
| Combo | Hits while the opponent is still in hit-stun. Each extra hit does 10% less damage (down to 40%). |
| Knockdown | Opponent is launched, lies down and cannot be hit while getting up. |
| Super meter | Fills when you hit or get hit. At full, Super Art = your special with double damage and a knockdown. |
| Input buffer | A button press is remembered for 8 frames, so slightly-early presses still come out. |

All move numbers (startup, active, recovery, damage, hit-stun, guard height) are in `ATK` in `src/config.js`; damage rules are in `src/combat.js`.

## Character select, options and tutorial

- Character select gives players 30 seconds. An unselected player is assigned a random fighter when time expires.
- In CPU mode, the CPU panel starts empty and the CPU randomly chooses after Player 1 locks in.
- The seventh roster tile, marked `? RANDOM`, starts a 3-second random roll. The roll does not lock the fighter; select **LOCK IN** when ready. Press `R` to roll for the active player.
- CPU difficulty is selectable on the home screen: Easy, Normal or Hard.
- **Settings** on the home screen or pause menu gives separate 0–100 sliders for music, menu/select sounds, fight effects and announcer voice, plus master mute. Choices are saved on this device. Menu music switches to the chosen stage's battle track when a match starts. Local announcer calls cover each round, Ready and Fight; the browser speaks the winning fighter's name. Selection countdown and random rolls have their own sound cues. Sources and licenses are listed in `assets/audio/ASSETS.md`.
- **Combo Dojo** is a practice mode for all eight combo skills. Choose a fighter and combo, then chain the displayed attacks on a passive dummy. Clearing a challenge moves on to the next one automatically (the HUD shows how many you have cleared). The dummy stands its ground (no pushback, so every chain stays in reach), recovers and cannot be knocked out. Press `R` to reset, `Q/E` or `[/]` to switch challenges, and `Esc` to pause.
- **Controller support** uses the browser Gamepad API. The first two connected controllers map to Players 1 and 2. The D-pad or left stick moves, the four face buttons attack, LT / RT block, and Start pauses or confirms.
- **Stage themes** are picked after both fighters lock in: Neon City, Mountain Dojo, Volcano Pit, Moonlit Harbor and Storm Rooftop. Each has its own backdrop, ambient effects and battle music (previewed while you choose). Left / Right or `1`–`5` choose, `R` picks at random, Enter or a second click starts the fight, Esc goes back. The last stage is remembered.
- **Reduced Motion** in Settings disables camera shake, hit sparks, white hit flashes, idle bob and projectile trails. The setting is saved on this device.
- **Tutorial** on the home screen explains movement, blocking, attacks, combo chains and special cancels.
- Pause menu: Resume, Rematch, Exit Match and Settings. Exit Match asks for Yes / No confirmation.

Combo skills (extra damage on top of normal combo damage; each skill pays once per combo, longer skills upgrade it):

| Skill | Sequence | Bonus |
|---|---|---|
| TRIPLE JAB | Punch, Punch, Punch | +6 |
| TRIPLE STRIKE | Punch, Punch, Kick | +10 |
| LOW RUSH | Down+Punch, Down+Punch, Down+Kick | +8 |
| CHAIN KICK | Down+Punch, Punch, Kick | +9 |
| AIR RAID | Fly Kick, Punch | +7 |
| PUNCH CANCEL | Punch, Special | +8 |
| KICK CANCEL | Kick, Special | +10 |
| MEGA COMBO | Punch, Punch, Kick, Special | +20 and knockdown |

Normal attacks leave enough hit-stun for follow-ups, with combo damage scaling of 8% per hit down to 50%. Edit skills in `COMBOS` in `src/config.js`.

## Game flow and difficulty

```
Main menu
 |- 1 PLAYER VS CPU -> Choose your challenge (Easy / Normal / Hard) -> Fighter select -> Stage theme -> Match
 |- 2 PLAYERS -------------------------------------------------------> Fighter select -> Stage theme -> Match
 |- COMBO DOJO / TUTORIAL / SETTINGS
```

- **Choose your challenge** appears when you start a 1-player game. Each level says what the CPU will do, so you can pick without guessing. `1 / 2 / 3` quick-picks, Enter or click continues, Esc goes back.
- **Change it any time:** the pause menu has a `CPU LEVEL` row (Left/Right, 1-player matches only) that applies immediately; the match-over screen has `D` / tap to change it before the rematch; Settings keeps the same `CPU DIFFICULTY` row.
- The last level you used is remembered in the browser (`localStorage`).
- The level is shown in the match HUD (`CPU HARD`) and on the fighter-select screen.

## Match flow, loading screens and the Dojo (latest changes)

- **Match-over screen** (VS CPU and 2 Players): clickable `REMATCH`, `CHANGE FIGHTERS` and `EXIT` buttons. Keyboard still works: `W/S` + Enter, `R` rematch, `C` change fighters, Esc exit. In 1-player the CPU level can still be changed here (`D` or click).
- **Stage select** now needs a confirmation: clicking a stage only selects it (and previews its music); press **START FIGHT** (or Enter) to continue.
- **Loading screen** appears before every fight (after the stage, on a rematch) and before the Combo Dojo. It shows the fighters, a progress bar and a tip, preloads the fighters' sprite sheets and the stage music, lasts at least ~1.8 seconds, and has a hard time limit so a slow download can never freeze the game. Esc goes back.
- **Combo Dojo**
  - The challenge panel now grows with the combo, so the move boxes always stay inside it.
  - Clearing a challenge no longer loops. Challenges 1-7 ask `NEXT CHALLENGE` or `EXIT`; challenge 8 asks `RESTART CHALLENGES` or `EXIT`. Practice is frozen while you decide.
  - The Dojo pause menu is `RESUME`, `EXIT` (asks Yes/No) and `SETTINGS`.
- **Blocking** shows a guard pose and a pale shield in front of the fighter while the block button (`V` / `/`) or back is held.

## Arcade modes (main menu -> ARCADE MODES, or press `M` / `3`)

| Mode | How it works | Saved in this browser |
|---|---|---|
| **Arcade Ladder** | 5 fights against 5 different rivals, best of 3 rounds, on a different stage each time. The CPU level ramps up (Easy start: Easy, Easy, Normal, Normal, Hard; it never goes above Hard). 2 continues. | Best clear time, number of clears |
| **Survival** | Endless one-round fights. You recover 30% of your max health after each win and keep your remaining health. CPU gets stronger every 3 wins. One loss ends the run. | Best win streak (also counted if you quit mid-run) |
| **Time Attack** | The 5-fight ladder, but one round per fight, no continues. The clock only runs while you are actually fighting (not during intros, loading or K.O. screens). | Best time (only completed runs count) |
| **Extreme Battle** | A normal 1-player match (with stage select) where a rule changes the game: **Low Gravity**, **Turbo**, **Glass Cannon** (x2.5 damage), **Super Fever** (full meter, fills 3x faster), **Sudden Drain** (health slowly drains, never to zero), or **Chaos** (a new random rule every round). | - |

Flow: Arcade Modes -> (CPU level) -> fighter select -> the run starts straight away (opponents are chosen for you, so there is no CPU pick or stage screen). Between fights a loading screen shows who is next. The pause menu in a run is `RESUME / RESTART RUN / EXIT RUN / SETTINGS`. After a run you can `PLAY AGAIN`, `CHANGE FIGHTER` or `EXIT`.

Where to change things: `MODE_CARDS`, `EXTREME_MODS`, `RUN_FIGHTS`, `RUN_CONTINUES` in `src/config.js`; run logic is in the "arcade modes" section of `src/game.js`; rule effects are in `fighter.js` (speed, gravity), `combat.js` (damage, meter) and `game.js` (drain, starting meter).
